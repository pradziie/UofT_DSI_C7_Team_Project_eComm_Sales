## ProfitLens: Visualizing E-Commerce Trends

Business proposal - "Our goal is to understand which products, regions, and discount strategies drive the highest profitability and how data-driven decisions can improve business outcomes"

E-Commerce dataset from Kaggle to study how different factors — like products, regions, and discounts — affect sales and profit. We want to find out which areas of the business make the most money and how companies can use data to make smarter decisions.

## Objectives 
Clean and organize the data for analysis. Find patterns between Sales, Profit, and Discounts. Identify which categories and regions are most profitable. Create easy-to-understand charts and graphs to share results. Build a model to predict future profit or sales
